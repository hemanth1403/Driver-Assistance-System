<h2>Driver Assistance System</h2>

Road safety has always been an important concern for development and public safety since it is one of the main causes of injury and death across the world.
Active engagement with the development of modern transportation systems, road safety measures, and other collaborations could assist in reducing the number of traffic accidents.
The proposed research seeks to make a contribution significantly to the various initiatives to broaden Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).
It comprises a set up of six components: drowsiness recognition and alerting system, lane detection, lane departure warning system, lane maintaining assistance system,
object detection and recognition, and collision warning system. The drowsiness detection and alert system is engaged throughout the ride to monitor the driver's focus levels.
Lane detection is then carried out using an ultrafast lane detector, that delivers spatial awareness by recognizing road lane markings.
The lane departure system thus activates whenever the vehicle deviates from the lane without signaling, alerting the driver immediately.
As the vehicle continues to deviate from the lane, the lane keeping assistance system detects and adjusts the vehicle's steering to keep it in the lane.
Concurrently, recognition and detection of objects applying YOLO recognize a wide range of items on the road, that serve as crucial in collision warning systems.
The collision warning system employs OpenCV and distance measurement to monitor the vehicle's surroundings and alert the driver about possible collision risks.
The integration aims to enhance driver safety through providing timely warnings and offering assistance throughout the driving process.

The proposed system has 2 point of views

1. POV_1 -> Monitoring the external environment
2. POV_2 -> Monitoring the internal environment

<h3>POV_1 : Monitoring the external environment </h3>
